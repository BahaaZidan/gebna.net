## Compliance
- [ ] `Identity/set` currently rejects any create/update where `name` is omitted/empty and forces the identity email to exactly match the account address, but RFC 8620 allows `name` to be null/absent and permits servers to expose multiple “send as” addresses; relax those checks and persist whatever addresses the user is authorized for instead of hard-coding one address (apps/backend/src/lib/jmap/method-handlers/identity-set.ts:20-88,112-184).
- [ ] `EmailSubmission/set` returns `invalidArguments` for every destroy request, even though the spec requires destroying a pending submission to cancel it (and destroying a sent one to succeed as a no-op); implement destroy semantics instead of the blanket rejection (apps/backend/src/lib/jmap/method-handlers/email-submission-set.ts:392-410).
- [ ] The Submission account capability always advertises `submissionExtensions: []` even though we support delayed send via `sendAt`/undo, so per RFC 8621 we must list the `urn:ietf:params:jmap:submission:delay` extension whenever `maxDelayedSend` > 0 (apps/backend/src/jmap.routes.ts:28-40,126-133).
