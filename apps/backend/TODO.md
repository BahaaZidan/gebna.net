- [ ] Persist per-blob metadata (type/name) at upload time and include those fields in `Blob/get`, and expand `Blob/lookup` `typeNames` beyond `"Email"` so clients can resolve `EmailBodyValue` references as mandated by RFC 8621 (`apps/backend/src/lib/jmap/method-handlers/blob.ts:16-149`, `apps/backend/src/jmap.routes.ts:292-375`).
- [ ] Extend structured `Email/set` create to handle attachments referencing uploaded blobs (and fold them into the generated MIME) instead of limiting drafts to `textBody`/`htmlBody` only (`apps/backend/src/lib/jmap/method-handlers/email-set.ts:403-575`).
